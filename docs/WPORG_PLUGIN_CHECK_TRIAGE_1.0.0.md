# WordPress.org Plugin Check Triage 1.0.0

Date: 2026-06-22

## Scope

- Raw output saved at `docs/plugin-check-1.0.0-raw.txt`
- Tool: `wp --skip-plugins=event-tickets,event-tickets-plus,the-events-calendar,woocommerce,woocommerce-square,vms plugin check <extracted-package-dir> --slug=vms --mode=new --format=json`
- Scan target for current counts: extracted packaged directory from `dist/wporg-07a/vms-1.0.0-public-release.zip` under a disposable temp path outside the local site tree, leaving the local `vms/` install untouched
- Current artifact SHA-256: `94507b4c77d748be22553a042e573f0126336692b5d7cbb80d7a4b1fd748b6b2`

## Fixed In This Pass

- 07A candidate scan summary
  - `includes/modules/admissions/pass-claims.php` - `173` total / `23` errors / `150` warnings - `133` DB/SQL findings - dominant `DirectQuery`, `NoCaching`, `UnescapedDBParameter`, and interpolated/not-prepared SQL - admissions claims batch/report/export helpers - risk `medium`/`high` - skipped because the remaining reads are interleaved with admissions claim and export behavior
  - `includes/core/staffing.php` - `153` total / `38` errors / `115` warnings - `121` DB/SQL findings - dominant schema introspection, direct-query/no-caching, and interpolated table SQL - shared staffing/runtime helper surface - risk `high` - skipped because read and write behavior are tightly interleaved through core staffing helpers
  - `includes/modules/staff-tasks/store.php` - `90` total / `17` errors / `73` warnings - `89` DB/SQL findings - dominant direct-query/no-caching plus not-prepared store queries - staff-task CRUD store - risk `high` - skipped because the file is an explicit create/update/delete repository
  - `includes/modules/availability-date-dispatch/helpers.php` - `96` total / `19` errors / `77` warnings - `85` DB/SQL findings - dominant direct-query/no-caching, unescaped DB parameters, and interpolated SQL - ADD dispatch/vendor-assignment helpers - risk `high` - skipped because assignment and scheduling behavior dominates the remaining queries
  - `includes/social-share/queue-repo.php` - `73` total / `7` errors / `66` warnings - `73` DB/SQL findings - dominant repository direct queries and queue/account/template row mutations - social queue repository - risk `high` - skipped because the file is mutation-centric rather than a read-only reporting slice
  - `includes/modules/admissions/rest.php` - `65` total / `11` errors / `54` warnings - `58` DB/SQL findings - dominant admissions REST reads/writes mixed with nonce/input and logging pressure - admissions REST runtime - risk `high` - skipped because scan, check-in, and request mutation flows are mixed through the same file
  - `includes/integrations/ticketing-claims-framework.php` - `50` total / `16` errors / `34` warnings - `49` DB/SQL findings - dominant grants/reservations/log/schema query helpers - ticketing claims integration framework - risk `high` - skipped because schema, reservation, and mutation behavior are interleaved
  - `includes/core/goals-forecast.php` - `38` total / `0` errors / `38` warnings - `37` DB/SQL findings - dominant direct-query/no-caching, unescaped DB parameters, and interpolated table SQL - admin-only goals forecast reporting helpers - risk `low` - selected because the remaining issues were isolated to three read-only helpers and the repo already uses `%i` placeholders elsewhere
  - `includes/core/vendor-user-links.php` - `36` total / `7` errors / `29` warnings - `36` DB/SQL findings - dominant direct-query/no-caching plus mixed prepared/not-prepared dynamic read helpers - shared vendor/user access-link surface - risk `medium`/`high` - skipped because it underpins portal/access-control linkage and still mixes reads with write coordination
  - `includes/modules/admissions/vendor-guest-portal.php` - `75` total / `36` errors / `39` warnings - `35` DB/SQL findings - dominant guest-portal DB reads plus public output/i18n pressure - public/vendor guest portal - risk `high` - skipped because public response handling and request logic remain mixed with the DB helpers
- additional DB or adjacent files inspected but not selected: `includes/modules/admissions/admission-tokens.php`, `includes/core/registry/vendor-schema.php`, `includes/safety/private-files.php`, and `includes/admin/settings/class-vms-settings-tours.php`
- `includes/core/goals-forecast.php`
  - `38` findings -> `32`
  - `37` DB/SQL findings -> `31`
  - `5` `PluginCheck.Security.DirectDB.UnescapedDBParameter` findings -> `2`
  - `5` `WordPress.DB.PreparedSQL.InterpolatedNotPrepared` findings -> `2`
  - limited the pass to `vms_goals_list()`, `vms_goals_get_goal()`, and `vms_goals_get_active_goal()` only, converting their existing table interpolation to `%i` identifier preparation without changing write paths, active-goal behavior, or save/delete logic
- Focused validation for this batch
  - no focused `goals-forecast` regression exists in `tests/`
  - `php -l includes/core/goals-forecast.php` passed
  - `git diff --check` passed
  - validation stayed on PHP lint, whitespace safety, public-release build, package integrity, and a rerun of packaged Plugin Check against an extracted packaged directory outside the local site tree
  - `php scripts/build-public-release.php --output-dir dist/wporg-07a --force --allow-dirty` passed
  - normalized packaged findings were saved to `test-results/wporg-07a-plugin-check.raw.txt` and promoted into `docs/plugin-check-1.0.0-raw.txt`

Code-level deltas visible in the packaged scan:

- `PluginCheck.Security.DirectDB.UnescapedDBParameter`: `155` -> `152`
- `WordPress.DB.PreparedSQL.InterpolatedNotPrepared`: `146` -> `143`
- `Database and SQL safety`: `1101` -> `1095`
- `includes/core/goals-forecast.php`: `38` -> `32`
- observed rerun-only change outside the selected file scope: `plugin_header_nonexistent_domain_path`: `1` -> `0`, `includes/helpers/checkin-close.php`: `1` -> `1`, `PluginCheck.CodeAnalysis.DiscouragedFunctions.load_plugin_textdomainFound`: `1` -> `1`

No previously unseen Plugin Check codes appeared in this pass. The extracted-package rerun again dropped the previously oscillating `plugin_header_nonexistent_domain_path` warning outside the selected file scope.

## Current Category Triage

| Category | Count | Representative files | Classification | Recommended strategy |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| Nonce and input handling | `1143` | `includes/cpt/event-plans.php`, `includes/vendor-applications.php`, `includes/integrations/ticketing-claims-admin.php`, `includes/integrations/ticketing-verifications.php` | BLOCKER | `WPORG-05E` closed the last low-risk read-only slice. `WPORG-07A` stayed on DB-only query preparation, so the remaining high-density nonce/input work is still concentrated in mutation-coupled admin, portal, ticketing, and Event Plans/integration flows that need dedicated regression coverage before hardening. |
| Database and SQL safety | `1095` | `includes/modules/admissions/pass-claims.php`, `includes/core/staffing.php`, `includes/modules/staff-tasks/store.php`, `includes/modules/availability-date-dispatch/helpers.php` | BLOCKER | Continue prioritizing `PluginCheck.Security.DirectDB.UnescapedDBParameter`, `PreparedSQL.NotPrepared`, and interpolated SQL findings before generic direct-query/no-caching warnings, but stay on read-only/admin-reporting slices where possible. |
| Escaping and output safety | `145` `OutputNotEscaped` findings | `includes/portal/staff-portal.php`, `includes/modules/admissions/vendor-guest-portal.php`, `includes/cpt/event-plans.php`, `includes/modules/availability-date-dispatch/admin-ui.php` | BLOCKER | Keep the escape-only audit paused after `WPORG-06C`; the remaining candidates are shared allowed-HTML boundaries, public/portal surfaces, metabox/save flows, vendor-assignment dashboards, or excluded Event Plans slices rather than isolated admin-only display targets. |
| I18n placeholder comments and ordering | `568` | `includes/cpt/event-plans.php`, `includes/integrations/ticketing-rules-v2.php`, `includes/integrations/ticketing-verifications.php`, `includes/core/staffing.php` | SHOULD FIX BEFORE SUBMISSION | Continue adding `translators:` comments and ordered placeholders after the remaining blocker categories are materially reduced. |
| Date/time API usage | `27` | `includes/modules/staff-tasks/notifications.php`, `includes/helpers.php`, `includes/ticketing/ticket-integrity-monitor.php` | SHOULD FIX BEFORE SUBMISSION | Review each remaining `date()` use. Convert display-only paths to explicit timezone-safe helpers and leave local-time-sensitive cases for deliberate follow-up review. |
| Development logging | `43` findings (`42` `error_log()` + `1` `debug_backtrace()`) | `includes/vendor-applications.php`, `includes/modules/admissions/rest.php`, `includes/cpt/event-plans.php` | SHOULD FIX BEFORE SUBMISSION | Remove or hard-gate residual development logging that is still reachable in packaged code. |

## Event Plans Conclusions

- The Event Plans file remains the highest-density packaged file at `241` findings.
- No Event Plans runtime findings were changed in `WPORG-07A`.
- The selected `goals-forecast.php` pass stayed completely outside Event Plans runtime and mutation logic.
- The read-only nonce/input phase remains closed after `WPORG-05E`, the escape-only phase remains paused after `WPORG-06C`, and `WPORG-07A` stayed completely outside Event Plans runtime.
- Remaining Event Plans findings are dominated by:
  - `save_event_plan_meta()` and adjacent request/save logic
  - the main Event Plan details render block tied to integration state
  - cancellation/refund, legacy ticket cleanup, and TEC/ticketing side-effect paths

## Recommended Next Task

- Post-`WPORG-07A` phased follow-up
- Scope:
  - continue the DB/SQL phase while keeping to isolated read-only admin/reporting helpers where a behavior-preserving slice is obvious
  - prioritize remaining parameter-safety and preparation issues in admissions, staffing, staff-task, ADD helper, and queue/store files only when the candidate can be carved away from mutation, schema, auth, or export behavior; otherwise pause that file
  - keep the escape-only phase paused after `WPORG-06C`; the remaining output-heavy files are shared boundaries, public/portal surfaces, vendor-assignment dashboards, metabox/save flows, or excluded Event Plans slices rather than isolated admin-only display targets
  - reserve the next nonce/input phase for mutation-coupled admin, portal, vendor-application, ticketing, and Event Plans/integration flows once regression coverage is ready
  - keep a separate i18n remainder phase for low-yield placeholder-comment leftovers such as `includes/admin/settings/class-vms-settings-notifications.php`, `includes/public/event-details.php`, and `includes/admin/staff-certifications.php` after the security-heavy phases move forward
