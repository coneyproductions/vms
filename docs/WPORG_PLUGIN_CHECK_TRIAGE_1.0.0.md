# WordPress.org Plugin Check Triage 1.0.0

Date: 2026-06-21

## Scope

- Raw output saved at `docs/plugin-check-1.0.0-raw.txt`
- Tool: `wp --skip-plugins=event-tickets,event-tickets-plus,the-events-calendar,woocommerce,woocommerce-square,vms plugin check <extracted-package-dir> --slug=vms --mode=new --format=json`
- Scan target for current counts: extracted packaged directory from `dist/wporg-04v/vms-1.0.0-public-release.zip` under a disposable temp path outside the local site tree, leaving the local `vms/` install untouched
- Current artifact SHA-256: `1a4df7d0d1cf157c02241fcac4db65fd229b9a395c5158a0d328e6dea78483c7`
- Heatmap companion: `docs/WPORG_PLUGIN_CHECK_HEATMAP_1.0.0.md`
- Event Plans audit companion: `docs/WPORG_EVENT_PLANS_HARDENING_MAP_1.0.0.md`

Net reduction from the `WPORG-02` source-tree baseline to the current packaged RC:

- `-1404` total findings
- `-708` errors
- `-696` warnings

Net reduction from `WPORG-04U`:

- `-7` total findings
- `-7` errors
- `0` warnings

## Fixed In This Pass

- 04V candidate scan summary
  - `includes/admin/approvals-review-queue.php` - `11` total / `7` errors / `4` warnings - dominant `EscapeOutput` (`4`) plus `MissingTranslatorsComment` (`3`) - isolated to admin approvals render boundaries, guided-tour helper HTML, and provider URL output - risk `medium` - selected
  - `includes/admin/menu.php` - `8` total / `5` errors / `3` warnings - dominant `EscapeOutput` (`4`) plus `MissingTranslatorsComment` (`1`) - admin dashboard render only, but helper-generated tour button HTML and pre-existing request/logging warnings remain mixed in - risk `medium` - skipped
  - `includes/admin-ui/shell.php` - `4` total / `4` errors / `0` warnings - dominant `EscapeOutput` (`4`) - isolated shared admin-shell output, but every fix would alter a common render boundary used across multiple screens - risk `medium` - skipped
  - `includes/public/calendar-ics.php` - `8` total / `5` errors / `3` warnings - dominant `MissingTranslatorsComment` (`4`) plus `EscapeOutput` (`1`) - mixed with read-only request parsing and raw ICS response output - risk `medium` - skipped
  - `includes/helpers.php` - `15` total / `6` errors / `9` warnings - dominant `date()` (`3`), `MissingTranslatorsComment` (`2`), and `EscapeOutput` (`1`) - findings are mixed through shared helper/date utilities, query helpers, and dashboard form output - risk `high` - skipped
  - `includes/core/vendor-document-alerts.php` - `8` total / `8` errors / `0` warnings - dominant `MissingTranslatorsComment` (`8`) - isolated i18n only, but notification-behavior-adjacent - risk `high` - skipped
  - `includes/modules/staff-tasks/notifications.php` - `5` total / `5` errors / `0` warnings - dominant `date()` (`5`) - technically isolated, but directly in notification scheduling logic - risk `high` - skipped
- `includes/admin/approvals-review-queue.php`
  - `11` findings -> `4`
  - `7` errors -> `0`
  - `4` warnings -> `4`
  - cleared the file's translator-comment and final-output escaping errors while leaving the existing logging, slow-query, and nonce warnings untouched
- Focused validation for this batch
  - no focused approvals-queue regression exists in `tests/`
  - `php -l includes/admin/approvals-review-queue.php` passed
  - `git diff --check` passed
  - validation stayed on PHP lint, whitespace safety, public-release build, package integrity, and a rerun of packaged Plugin Check against an extracted packaged directory outside the local site tree
  - Plugin Check stdout and stderr both carried the known WP-CLI phar deprecation line; the cleaned raw findings stayed in `docs/plugin-check-1.0.0-raw.txt`, and the deprecation noise was mirrored in `test-results/wporg-04v-plugin-check.stderr.txt`

Code-level deltas visible in the packaged scan:

- `WordPress.WP.I18n.MissingTranslatorsComment`: `567` -> `564`
- `WordPress.Security.EscapeOutput.OutputNotEscaped`: `169` -> `165`
- `includes/admin/approvals-review-queue.php`: `11` -> `4`
- observed rerun-only steady state outside the selected file scope: `plugin_header_nonexistent_domain_path`: `1` -> `1`

No previously unseen Plugin Check codes appeared in this pass, and the prior domain-path warning remained unchanged outside the selected file scope.

## Current Category Triage

| Category | Count | Representative files | Classification | Recommended strategy |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| Nonce and input handling | `1198` | `includes/cpt/event-plans.php`, `includes/vendor-applications.php`, `includes/integrations/ticketing-claims-admin.php`, `includes/integrations/ticketing-verifications.php` | BLOCKER | This pass stayed deliberately outside portal mutation and Event Plans save logic. The remaining high-density nonce/input work is still concentrated in `save_event_plan_meta()` and adjacent high-risk portal and integration flows. |
| Database and SQL safety | `1101` | `includes/modules/admissions/pass-claims.php`, `includes/core/staffing.php`, `includes/modules/staff-tasks/store.php`, `includes/modules/availability-date-dispatch/helpers.php` | BLOCKER | Prioritize `PluginCheck.Security.DirectDB.UnescapedDBParameter`, `PreparedSQL.NotPrepared`, and interpolated SQL findings before generic direct-query/no-caching warnings. |
| Escaping and output safety | `165` `EscapeOutput` findings | `includes/portal/staff-portal.php`, `includes/modules/admissions/vendor-guest-portal.php`, `includes/cpt/event-plans.php`, `includes/modules/availability-date-dispatch/admin-ui.php` | BLOCKER | The highest-yield remaining escape work is now concentrated in the Staff Portal, shared admin render shells, menu surfaces, and other render paths rather than the cleared approvals queue slice. |
| I18n placeholder comments and ordering | `580` | `includes/cpt/event-plans.php`, `includes/integrations/ticketing-rules-v2.php`, `includes/integrations/ticketing-verifications.php`, `includes/core/staffing.php` | SHOULD FIX BEFORE SUBMISSION | Continue adding `translators:` comments and ordered placeholders after the remaining blocker categories are materially reduced. |
| Date/time API usage | `27` | `includes/modules/staff-tasks/notifications.php`, `includes/helpers.php`, `includes/ticketing/ticket-integrity-monitor.php` | SHOULD FIX BEFORE SUBMISSION | Review each remaining `date()` use. Convert display-only paths to explicit timezone-safe helpers and leave local-time-sensitive cases for deliberate follow-up review. |
| Development logging | `43` findings (`42` `error_log()` + `1` `debug_backtrace()`) | `includes/vendor-applications.php`, `includes/modules/admissions/rest.php`, `includes/cpt/event-plans.php` | SHOULD FIX BEFORE SUBMISSION | Remove or hard-gate residual development logging that is still reachable in packaged code. |

## Event Plans Conclusions

- The Event Plans file remains the highest-density packaged file at `241` findings.
- No Event Plans runtime findings were changed in `WPORG-04V`.
- The selected `approvals-review-queue.php` pass stayed completely outside Event Plans runtime and mutation logic.
- The low-risk admin-only list/helper surface is effectively exhausted.
- Remaining Event Plans findings are dominated by:
  - `save_event_plan_meta()` and adjacent request/save logic
  - the main Event Plan details render block tied to integration state
  - cancellation/refund, legacy ticket cleanup, and TEC/ticketing side-effect paths

## Recommended Next Task

- `WPORG-04W`
- Scope:
  - repeat the deliberate hotspot scan from the `WPORG-04V` packaged baseline and prefer another isolated admin-only render or final-escaping slice before widening into request, auth, refund, ticketing, or availability-save flows
  - `includes/admin/menu.php` or `includes/admin-ui/shell.php` are better candidates than notification/date logic, shared helpers, or raw ICS output
  - if packaging-warning cleanup is preferred over another runtime-adjacent file, handle the unchanged `plugin_header_nonexistent_domain_path` warning in a separate metadata micro-batch
